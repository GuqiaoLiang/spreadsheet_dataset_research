        "answer": "The main insights indicate that treatments generally lead to slight variations in fold changes for both Runx1/b-actin and Runx3/b-actin but do not significantly alter their expressions. Treatments with SAG show inconsistent effects on fold change, and the addition of AG83 or GE1F8R does not consistently increase fold change either. Notably, 'DC + GE1F8R (24 h) + SAG' exhibits the least variability in fold changes for both genes, suggesting more consistent effects. Overall, the treatments result in minor fold change variations, indicating that none strongly induce differential expression of the studied genes."
